TODO

Short-term:
- Encapsulate Windows code in a class
- Normal maps
- Phong lighting
- Controllable camera
- Make shaders load dynamically
- Build more of DX11 RHI layer (so renderer doesn't reference DX11 directly)
- Set colours/textures on hexes based on height
- Tile types
- Abstraction of world rather than directly creating objects
- Raycast to determine hex/position clicked
- Ability to place tracks
- Keyboard and mouse input
- Figure out proper event loop setup (WndProc or all in main loop?)

Long-term:
- Hook up networking code from MMO project
- Server and client exes
- Threading
- Abstract platform-specific code behind platform layer

Done:
- Loading objects
- Multiple lights
- Unify texturing with lighting pass
- Move DX11 code to RHI layer
- Move scene update data (imgui sliders) out of the renderer
- Improve ergonomics of scene creation
- Hex grid
- Perlin-based heightmap generation
